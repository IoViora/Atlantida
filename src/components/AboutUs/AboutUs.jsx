            We have 12 main rules which are unbreakable
          </h2>
          <p className="homepageweare">
            1. Whatever you do, Make sure it serves to the best of this world
          </p>
          <p className="homepageweare">
            2. Never kill innocent, never show mercy to the guilty
          </p>
          <p className="homepageweare">
            3. Before sharpening you sword, always sparp your brain
          </p>
          <p className="homepageweare">
            4. Serve no king. King can be evil too. Serve no GOD. GOD only exist
            inside of you. Serve only to the future that you are trying to
            build.
          </p>
          <p className="homepageweare">
            5. Stay close to the light, but not so close that it blinds you.
            Stay in the dark so that you can see the light brighter. But don't
            let the darkness consume your soul
          </p>
          <p className="homepageweare">
            6. Never steal, never beg for mercy, never run from the enemy

          <p className="homepageweare">
            7. Be careful about who you call friend, and who you call enemy.

            8. Trust your brother in arms. And never betray their trust
          </p>

            9. Never talk bad about any man, woman, and religion
